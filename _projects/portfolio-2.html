<p style='text-align: justify;'>
    RoboCup is an international initiative that fosters research in robotics and artificial intelligence, on multi-robot systems in particular,
    through competitions of RoboCup Robot Soccer. <br><br>
    The RoboCup Standard Platform League is a RoboCup robot soccer league, in which all teams compete with identical robots and 
    operate fully autonomously, i.e. there is no external control, neither by humans nor by computers.
    The current standard platform used is the humanoid NAO by SoftBank Robotics.
